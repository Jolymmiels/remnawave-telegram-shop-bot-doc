## Admin Command Reference

### /sync

Synchronize users from Remnawave panel with database.

**What it does:**
- Fetches all users from Remnawave panel
- Updates existing users in database
- Removes users no longer present in Remnawave
- Ensures database consistency

**Usage:**
```
Send /sync command to the bot as admin
```

**Requires:**
- User ID in `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`
- Valid Remnawave API credentials
- Database connectivity

**When to use:**
- After bulk user changes in Remnawave
- To fix database inconsistencies
- As part of maintenance routine
- Before/after migrations

**Example scenario:**
```
Admin makes changes in Remnawave panel
→ Administrator runs /sync command
→ Bot fetches updated user list
→ Database synchronized
→ All consistent
```

## Future Commands

The following commands may be added:

- `/stats` - View statistics
- `/broadcast` - Send message to all users
- `/suspend <id>` - Suspend user
- `/ban <id>` - Ban user
- `/refund <id>` - Process refund
- `/export` - Export user data

## User Access Control

Only users with ID in `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` can run admin commands.

To set your admin ID:

```env
ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID=123456789
```

Find your Telegram ID:
- Send any message to [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot)
- Note the ID returned
- Add to configuration

## Command Permissions

| Command | Permission Required |
|---------|-------------------|
| `/start` | Any user |
| `/help` | Any user |
| `/sync` | Admin only |

## Best Practices

1. **Run /sync regularly** - Daily or weekly maintenance
2. **Check logs** - Verify successful execution
3. **Monitor performance** - Large sync operations may take time
4. **Backup database** - Before major operations
5. **Document changes** - Keep audit log of admin actions

## Troubleshooting

### /sync not working

**Check:**
- `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` matches your ID
- Remnawave API is accessible
- API credentials are valid
- Database connection is active

**Fix:**
```bash
# View logs
docker compose logs remnawave-telegram-shop-bot

# Check database
docker compose logs postgres

# Restart if needed
docker compose restart remnawave-telegram-shop-bot
```

### Access Denied

- Verify your Telegram ID
- Confirm it's in `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID`
- Restart bot: `docker compose down && docker compose up -d`

### Sync is slow

- Large user bases take time
- Check database performance
- Monitor server resources
- Run during off-peak hours

## Security Considerations

✅ Admin commands are secure  
✅ Only authorized users can execute  
✅ All actions are logged  
✅ Operations are atomic  

❌ Never share your admin ID  
❌ Don't broadcast sensitive info
